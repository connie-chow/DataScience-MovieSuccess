# DataScience-MovieSuccess
This project takes the inherent characteristics of a movie and attempts to predict its box office success

Project is written in python and is broken down into the following parts:

1. Loading and Cleaning Data
>> Use of various compiled datasets containing movie data such as IMdb, Rotten Tomatoes, themoviedatabase.org etc
>> Adjusted gross movie sales for inflation etc.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
>> Visualization of data to explore and discover patterns, correlations between dataset features
>> Correlation tables with heatmaps, bar charts etc.

3. Prediction Algorithms and Modeling
>> scikit and sklearn python libraries utilized
>> Modeled prediction algorithms with KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression

4. Prediction Results Analysis
>> Confusion Matrices etc. used to determine prediction accuracy and make iterative adjustments to prediction model
